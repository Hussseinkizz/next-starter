## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To have things set up and running is kind of easy, just clone the project to your machine and do yarn or npm install to install all packages and that's it, start minting your frontend. See below example.

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/Husseinkizz/next-starter

# Access
$ cd next-starter

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Run the project in development mode
$ yarn dev

# The server will initialize in the <http://localhost:3000>
```

### Prerequisites

You only need to have [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine and also yarn if that's what you use. You can always download and install node js from thier official website and to install yarn after installing node you can use the following command.

```bash
# Install yarn using npm
$ npm i yarn -g

```
